# RobloxTrader
A robotic trading program for Robux and Tickets (Tix) currencies in Roblox.

It used to work until Roblox got rid of the Tickets currency (https://blog.roblox.com/2016/03/saying-goodbye-to-tickets/).

When working, it would trade between Robux and Tix by looking for arbitrage opportunities in the order book.
